NWSR
====
NWSR, an acronym short for "News Weighted, Sampled Randomly", is an RSS reader
designed to spread your favorite feeds out onto your plate, whether they happen
to be fresh from the fridge or many months moldy.

Usage
-----
The reader takes items from news feeds and assigns them a random weight, mixing
items from different times and feeds into the main stream. Each item's rank
decays over time, allowing more "fresh" stories to build their way to the top
as you read them, but if you have a lot of feeds and only a little time to
read, you'll often find a nice mix of old and new spicing up your plate.

Built to run on Android version 2.1 "Eclair". What can I say? I have an old
phone.
